## Problems
[ ] Error is large (16%)
[ ] 



## Debugging strategies
[x] Check distribution of domain among processes
[x] check end points of domain (should be similar to serial version) -- *little difference doesn't matter*
[x] Remove distribution of domain and generate domain then distribute it to all. -- *no difference*
[ ] Is there any other problem than difference in end points?
