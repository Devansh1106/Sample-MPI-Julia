## Problems
- [ ] Error is large (16%)
- [ ] 



## Debugging strategies
- [x] Check distribution of domain among processes -- *correct*
- [x] check end points of domain (should be similar to serial version) -- *little difference doesn't matter*
- [x] Remove distribution of domain and generate domain then distribute it to all. -- *no difference in both ways*
- [ ] Is there any other problem than difference in end points? -- yes
